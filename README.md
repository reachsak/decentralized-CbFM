# Community-based Facilities Management in Smart Buildings Using Blockchain-based DAO


## Overview

This project explores the development of a **Blockchain-based Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** for **community-based management of smart buildings**. By promoting decentralized governance and stakeholder engagement, the project aims to enhance transparency, efficiency, and collaboration in facilities management.

The system encourages building occupants and stakeholders to actively contribute to the maintenance, improvement, and sustainability of shared building infrastructure. Using blockchain technology, the DAO ensures transparent, decentralized decision-making and incentivizes participation through fungible and non-fungible tokens.

## Key Components

### 1. **Physical Component:** 
   - The **building infrastructure**, which serves as the environment where occupants interact with the DAO.

### 2. **Decentralized Governance Platform:**
   - Facilitates proposal submission, voting, and approval processes.
   - Incorporates **tokenization** to incentivize participation, rewarding users with fungible tokens and ERC-721 standard NFTs based on their engagement in the governance process.
   - Proposals may include sustainability initiatives, maintenance requests, or feedback on building operations.

### 3. **Maintenance Management Platform:**
   - Allows occupants to submit **maintenance requests, work orders, feedback**, and sustainability proposals through a Decentralized Application (DApp).
   - Supports the inclusion of multimedia files (images, videos) that are stored on a **decentralized storage system** to maintain data transparency and minimize on-chain costs.

### Tokenization and Incentives:
   - Occupants are rewarded with **fungible tokens** for valid maintenance reports or participation in voting.
   - **Non-fungible reputation tokens (NFTs)** are distributed to recognize consistent contributions, reinforcing a reputation-based system that encourages long-term involvement.

### Smart Contracts:
   - The **incentivization logic** is encoded in **smart contracts**, ensuring fair and transparent distribution of rewards based on pre-established rules and conditions.

## Framework Overview

The project framework consists of three main components:
   1. **Physical Component** - The building infrastructure.
   2. **Decentralized Governance Platform** - Handles proposal submission, voting, and tokenized incentives.
   3. **Maintenance Management Platform** - Manages maintenance requests, feedback, and proposal submissions.

Through this integrated system, the framework aims to increase stakeholder engagement, streamline facilities management processes, and support sustainable practices within smart buildings.
